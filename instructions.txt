Make a To-Do List App using React. The application should have a form that accepts a task and updates the state of the app to include the task in the array. The app should also display the tasks under form.

Step:
1. Create React App
2. Add Components (Nav, Form, To-Do Display, To-Do Card etc.)
3. Set the app state for to-dos that is initially an empty array
4. When then form is submitted, add the task to the array and update the state
5. Display all of the To-Dos using props
